# efi-install-guide-source
The ([MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org)) source pages for "Sakaki's EFI Install Guide" (as hosted on the Gentoo wiki, [here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide)).

These pages _can_ be accessed individually via the Gentoo site, but they are gathered here in one place for convenience (and as a backup).

If you want to update the pages manually to the most recent version, enter the directory and run:
```console
./download_pages.sh pages.txt
```

A weekly cronjob runs this (included) `download_pages.sh` script, and uploads any changes here automatically.

All source pages are licensed (per the Gentoo wiki standards), under [CC-BY-SA-3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Currently, images used in the pages are not archived in this repository.
